## About
march is a notion alternative for getting things done—the tool we wished existed, so we're building it ourselves. We've tried Notion, Obsidian, Anytype, Todoist, etc., but none of them felt quite right. Those are great apps, and if they work for you, we're not saying March will be better. But here’s what makes March different:

- **Connected Workflow:** March integrates with all your favorite tools and automatically collects action items into a universal inbox.
- **Simple Object-Based System:** Everything—meetings, bookmarks, Linear issues—is treated as an object with a type. You can customize views based on object types.
- **Dynamic Interface:** Build your own productivity page/ space with blocks, you decide how your action items should look like.
- **Smart Organization:** No tedious templates—March organizes your data dynamically based on behavior and object types.
- **AI-Powered only where it needed:** march can perform actions in connected apps and reminds you what you should consume ( i.e the twitter bookmark you saved but never opened) 

March is currently **free and open source**, maintained by **[@oliursahin](https://github.com/oliursahin)** and **[@sajdakabir](https://github.com/sajdakabir)**. If you love using it, consider [buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/oliursahin)—it helps us keep the servers running.

> **Alpha Notice:** march is still in an alpha stage and is only suitable for enthusiastic testers willing to endure bugs and an incomplete app. However, it's our daily driver, and we are actively developing it.

## 🚀 Try the Alpha
- **[app.march.cat](https://app.march.cat)**

- We provide access to early testers who can help us improve the app as we build it.
